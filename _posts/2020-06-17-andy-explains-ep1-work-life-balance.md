Andy Ellis ([@csoandy][1]), CSO at Akamai Technologies, joins Steve Ragan for a discussion about work / life balance, in this inaugural segment called Andy Explains. Today's Andy Explains segment is an important one, as the balance between daily life and work has become central to people across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of the items discussed include distractions, and the importance of management providing multiple levels of support to employees. The key consideration is that most of us are not working from home, we're working in crisis. This is not a normal work-from-home routine, but a situation that needs to be managed and navigated, because there are times when a "normal workday" just isn't possible.
