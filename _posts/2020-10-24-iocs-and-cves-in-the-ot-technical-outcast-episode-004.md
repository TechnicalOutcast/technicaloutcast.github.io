Today we're joined by Ron Brash ([@ron_brash][1]), the Director of Cyber Security Insights at ([Verve Industrial Protection][2]).

In this episode, Steve and Ron talk about operational technologies (OT), and how CVEs are a tricky task to tackle these days. In addition, the two discuss the issues related to Ripple 20 - the collection of zero-day vulnerabilities in a widely used low-level TCP/IP software library developed by Treck, Inc that were [disclosed by JSOF][3].
