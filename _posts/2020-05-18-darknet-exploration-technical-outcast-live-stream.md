Host Steve Ragan, joined by Krpyt3ia and rand0h, introduce Technical Outcast to the public during a live stream to [raise money for Ocean Academy][1]. The episode covers the basics of the Darknet, as well as other aspects of the criminal economy.

The Ocean Academy is the only high school on Caye Caulker, an island of Belize. The students and school have been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Technical Outcast was recorded live as part of a 24-hour stream to benefit the kids. In the end, the donation drive raised more than $50,000 for the school, which was an amazing accomplishment.

It was a pleasure to be involved.
